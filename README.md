## Description
A Java program that reads a sequence of non-negative integers from the user, determines the largest integer, and calculates the average of all input values. The program stops when a negative integer is entered and then outputs the largest integer and the average of the non-negative integers (formatted to two decimal places).

## Installation Requirements
Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download it from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or use a package manager like Homebrew for macOS or apt-get for Linux. 

- Clone or download the repository: 
```Java 
- git clone https://github.com/your-username/VariedInputData.git 
```

- Navigate to the project directory: 
```Java
- cd VariedInputData 
```
- Compile the VariedInputData.java file: 
```Java
- javac VariedInputData.java 
```
- Run the program: 
```Java
- java VariedInputData
```

## Application Usage
Once the program is running, it will prompt you to input integers. Continue entering positive integers, and the program will track the maximum integer and calculate the average of all inputs. The input sequence ends when a negative integer is entered.  

Example:

Enter integers: 
```Java
5 3 7 -1 
```

The output will be:
```Java
7 5.00
```

## Test Commands
Test the program with various sets of integers, including negative numbers to ensure the program halts correctly and calculates the maximum and average accurately.
